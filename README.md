# COORDinator

To install the appropriate environment, use `coordinator.yaml`, then run `pip install -U -e .` from the directory you have installed COORDinator in. Then run 'python -m ipykernel install --user --name=coordinator' or 'conda install -c anaconda ipykernel' from the coordinator environment to enable the coordinator environment in Jupyter.

To run predictions, use `/analysis/2025_02_06_run_model.ipynb`. There are instructions in that file that explain what inputs are required.
